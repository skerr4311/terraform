## General info
This repo holds some basic terraform templates I have created over time working with DevOps and Azure. These are fantastic when set up correctly in DevOps to deal with disaster recovery. You can easily change the variables to destroy and redeploy app services or logic apps in any region or subscription in Azure. 

## Create Logic App
This is a a fairly simple to understand flow.
---
## Create Logic App Route Through API Gateway
This one is a little more complex 
---
## Logic App for connecting to storage account
This one makes use of azures trusted connections. This means you can completely lock off a storage account and only allow requests that come from this logic app.
---
## App Service With Custom DNS for Blazor
This script follows a very specific process.
